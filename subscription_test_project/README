Sorry but i need to sleep ...

Cd in the sample project.

Run::
    
    ./manage.py runserver

Open http://localhost:8000/admin
Login with user 'steve' and password 'test'

Open http://localhost:8000/users/steve/


Now, in another console, run: ./manage.py shell

And paste this line as many times as you want. It creates a comment and sends the notification.
from subscription.examples.yourlabs.apps.comments import CommentNotification; from django.contrib.comments.models import Comment; from django.contrib.auth.models import User; CommentNotification(Comment(user=User.objects.get(pk=1), comment='hi', content_object=User.objects.get(pk=2), site_id=1)).emit()

Wait a few seconds and the counter and dropdown inner html should be updated !
